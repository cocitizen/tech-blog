The obligatory first post... There are many like it, but this one is mine.

I'm Christopher, the CTO of [CoCitizen](http://www.cocitizen.com). We're a new startup based near Washington, DC. While the organization is new, my fellow co-citizens and I have been pursuing various technological innovation, international development and civic engagement projects throughout our careers.

We don't have a polished mission statement yet. But, we're looking to start by making [DemTools](https://dem.tools) available to everyone. DemTools are a suite of hosted web applications developed under the auspices of the [National Democratic Institute (NDI)](https://ndi.org). They provide civic organizations, legislatures, and political parties with the capabilities to effectively engage their constituents and build better democracies.

My co-founders, Chris and Christine (too many Chris's!?!) have a tonne of experience in international relations, program development and civic engagement, in addition to a deep understanding and appreciation of web technologies and digital security. That said, I'm the most technical among us, spending most of my time programming (well, ok, debugging), hence the "T" in my title.

We're committed to free/libre open-source software, and all our hosting is run on an entirely free/libre software stack. I'm a long-time contributor to the [Drupal](http://www.drupal.org) community, and the project lead of the [Aegir Hosting System](http://docs.aegirproject.org), which we use extensively for hosting DemTools. These days, I spend an innordinate amount of time writing [Ansible](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible) roles. So expect to see those and lots of other FLOSS projects as regular topics.
