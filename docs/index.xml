      <description>&amp;ldquo;Tweet&amp;rdquo; and other social media sharing buttons are pretty much ubiquitous these days. That&amp;rsquo;s assuming you aren&amp;rsquo;t using something like the Ghostery browser plugin. If you are, then those buttons are likely being blocked because they use techniques like tracking cookies to record your browsing behaviour. Bear in mind, this isn&amp;rsquo;t standard web analytics, looking at how you interact with an organization&amp;rsquo;s own website. Instead, these &amp;ldquo;share&amp;rdquo; buttons allow social networking companies to track you across any site that has one of these buttons.</description>

      <description>The obligatory first post&amp;hellip; There are many like it, but this one is mine.
I&amp;rsquo;m Christopher, the CTO of CoCitizen. We&amp;rsquo;re a new startup based near Washington, DC. While the organization is new, my fellow co-citizens and I have been pursuing various technological innovation, international development and civic engagement projects throughout our careers.
We don&amp;rsquo;t have a polished mission statement yet. But, we&amp;rsquo;re looking to start by making DemTools available to everyone.</description>
